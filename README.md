# processing_printer

For module 4/5 of Creative Embedded Systems we were tasked with actuating the world by making creative interactive kinetic art while using motors. Justin Cong and Jordan Smith decided to create a machine that takes and img file and prints it physically on paper using a writing utensil of choice.

In order to re-create our work one would need: A Raspberry Pi 3 B+, 4 servo motors, two popsicle sticks, two binder clips (one small and one large), a breadboard, a switch, access to Python, and access to processing.
