BrachioGraph - the cheapest, simplest possible pen-plotter
==========================================================


BrachioGraph is an ultra-cheap (total cost of materials: ~â‚¬14) plotter that can be built with minimal skills.

At its heart is a Raspberry Pi Zero and some relatively simple custom software, driving three servo motors.

The mechanical hardware can be built from nothing but stiff card, a pen or pencil and some glue. The only tools required are a ruler and a sharp knife.

Almost everything required can be found in a desk or kitchen drawer. The entire device can be built with no special skills in about an hour.
